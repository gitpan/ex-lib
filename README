NAME
    ex::lib - The same as "lib", but makes relative path absolute.

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    Simple use like "use lib ...":

            use ex::lib qw(./mylibs1 ../mylibs2);
            use ex::lib 'mylibs';

THE GOAL
    The main reason of this library is transformate relative paths to
    absolute at the "BEGIN" stage, and push transformed to @INC. This is
    useful, when you running under "mod_perl", use something like
    "Apache::StatINC", and your application may change working directory.
    When using common "lib", relative paths stays relative to curernt
    working directory, So in case of chdir "StatINC" fails to reload module.
